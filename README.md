# Forecasting deaths and analyzing age trends of COVID-19 cases in Florida

*Updated: 06 July 2020*

Authors: Marc Bevand, Michael A. Alcorn

The Florida Department of Health has an **amazing** dataset here: [complete line
list data of the state's COVID-19 cases][dataset], including age information
for all 150k+ cases! We provide two scripts:
* `forecast_deaths.py` forecasts deaths based on age-stratified Case Fatality Ratios (CFR)
* `heatmap.py` creates a heatmap representing the number of cases by age bracket over time

## Forecasting deaths

`forecast_deaths.py` does not rely on death data, but relies
**solely** on case ages, date of first symptoms, and published age-stratified CFR
estimates.

The script starts by downloading the [FDOH line list dataset][dataset]. This gives us
(1) the age of every case diagnosed with COVID-19, and (2) the date of first symptoms
(`EventDate` CSV column.)

Then it multiplies the number of cases by age bracket with age-stratified Case Fatality Ratios issued from 4 independent models:

1. [The Epidemiological Characteristics of an Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19) — China, 2020][m1] (table 1, Case fatality rate)
1. [Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis][m2] (table 1, CFR, Adjusted for censoring, demography, and under-ascertainment)
1. [https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Bollettino-sorveglianza-integrata-COVID-19_26-marzo%202020.pdf][m3] (table 1, Casi totali, % Letalità)
1. [Case fatality risk by age from COVID-19 in a high testing setting in Latin America: Chile, March-May, 2020][m4] (table 2, Latest estimate)

Then it assumes death occurs on average 17.8 days after infection, which is the mean onset-to-death time reported in
[Estimating the effects of nonpharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in Europe, Supplementary information, page 4][o2d].

The end result is a simple and accurate forecast that can not only
estimate deaths up to ~18 days ahead of time, but can also estimate *past*
deaths: notice how the colored curves produced by the model follow closely the
black curve (actual deaths.)

Actual deaths are fetched from the [New York Times Covid-19 data repository][nyt] and
are only used to draw the black curve. They are used as part of the forecast.

The forecast curves and actual death curve are smoothed with a 7-day centered moving average.

Since the model uses line list data, ie. *detected* cases, it is important that
we feed it CFR estimates, not IFR estimates. Infection Fatality Ratios take
into account undetected cases and thus would not be consistent with line
list data.

## Heatmap of age over time

`heatmap.py` downloads the dataset automatically, creates the heatmap
(`heatmap.png`) and also produces a numerical summary:

(Last period's data may be incomplete. Age unknown for 225 out of 152434 cases.)
```

The number of cases is increasing among *all* age brackets. However the median age of
cases is declining because younger people appear to be driving increased transmission,
especially the 20-24 age bracket.

By default the size of each pixel, or *bucket*, is 5-year age brackets and 4-day
time periods. This can be changed by editing the variables `buckets_ages` and `buckets_days`.

For efficiency, you may download the CSV manually once, and pass it as an argument
to the script:

1. Browse the [line list data][dataset] page
1. Click `Download → Spreadsheet` to download the CSV file
1. Run `./heatmap.py <path-to-csv-file>`

## Miscellaneous

`heatmap.py` also creates `heatmap_age_share.png`: the pixel intensity represents
not the number of cases, but the share of cases in this age bracket among all
cases reported in this time period.

`sort.py` is a tool that strips the `ObjectId` column from the CSV file and sorts the
rows. This is helpful to compare 2 CSV files published on 2 different days, because
the `ObjectId` value and the order of rows are not stable from one file to another.
