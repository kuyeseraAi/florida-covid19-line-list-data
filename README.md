# Analyzing age trends of COVID-19 cases in Florida

*Updated: 26 June 2020*

Author: Marc Bevand

The Florida Department of Health has an **amazing** dataset here: [complete line
list data of the state's COVID-19 cases][dataset], including age information
for all 100k+ cases! My script processes that data:

1. Browse the [line list data][dataset] page
1. Click `Download â†’ Spreadsheet` to download the CSV file
1. Place the CSV file in this directory and name it `Florida_COVID19_Case_Line_Data.csv`
1. Run `./process.py`

Result:
```
$ ./process.py
Number of COVID-19 cases per 7-day time period in Florida by age bracket over time:

(Last period's data is incomplete. Age unknown for 139 out of 114018 cases)
```

The script also creates a heatmap (`heatmap.png`) of this data. Here it is over
smaller 5-year age brackets and 4-day time periods:

Edit `buckets_ages` and `buckets_days` in the script to control the size of the *buckets*
(age brackets and time periods.)

# Analysis

The number of cases is increasing among *all* age brackets. However the median age of
cases is declining because younger people appear to be driving increased transmission,
especially the 20-24 age bracket.

# Miscellaneous

`sort.py` is a tool that strips the `ObjectId` column from the CSV file and sorts the
rows. This is helpful to compare 2 CSV files published on 2 different days, because
the `ObjectId` value and the order of rows are not stable from one file to another.
