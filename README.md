# Analyzing age trends of COVID-19 cases in Florida

*Updated: 30 June 2020*

Authors: Marc Bevand, Michael A. Alcorn

The Florida Department of Health has an **amazing** dataset here: [complete line
list data of the state's COVID-19 cases][dataset], including age information
for all 150k+ cases! Our script `process.py` analyzes this data to create a heatmap
representing the number of cases by age bracket over time:

The script downloads the dataset automatically, creates the heatmap
(`heatmap.png`) and also produces a numerical summary like this:

(Last period's data may be incomplete. Age unknown for 225 out of 152434 cases.)
```

By default the size of each pixel, or *bucket*, is 5-year age brackets and 4-day
time periods. This can be changed by editing the variables `buckets_ages` and `buckets_days`.

For efficiency, you may download the CSV manually once, and pass it as an argument
to the script:

1. Browse the [line list data][dataset] page
1. Click `Download â†’ Spreadsheet` to download the CSV file
1. Run `./process.py <path-to-csv-file>`

[dataset]: https://open-fdoh.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/florida-covid19-case-line-data

# Analysis

The number of cases is increasing among *all* age brackets. However the median age of
cases is declining because younger people appear to be driving increased transmission,
especially the 20-24 age bracket.

# Miscellaneous

`process.py` also creates `heatmap_age_share.png`: the pixel intensity represents
not the number of cases, but the share of cases in this age bracket among all
cases reported in this time period.

`sort.py` is a tool that strips the `ObjectId` column from the CSV file and sorts the
rows. This is helpful to compare 2 CSV files published on 2 different days, because
the `ObjectId` value and the order of rows are not stable from one file to another.
